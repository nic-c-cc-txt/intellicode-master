# Visual Studio IntelliCode FAQ

This FAQ answers some of the questions you may have about Visual Studio IntelliCode.

## Q: Are there any differences between IntelliCode for Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code?

IntelliCode for Visual Studio offers some additional functionality over the extension for Visual Studio Code, including autogenerated EditorConfig files and customized IntelliSense based on your code. For more information, see [IntelliCode for Visual Studio](intellicode-visual-studio.md) and [IntelliCode extension for Visual Studio Code](intellicode-visual-studio-code.md).

## Q: What makes “AI-assisted IntelliSense” better than regular IntelliSense?

With IntelliCode, the completion list suggests the most likely correct API for a developer to use rather than presenting a simple alphabetical list of members. To provide this dynamic list, IntelliCode uses the developer's current code context and patterns based on thousands of highly rated, open-source projects on GitHub. The results form a model that predicts the most likely and most relevant API calls.

For C# developers, IntelliCode can learn patterns from your code. This means IntelliCode can make recommendations on code that isn’t in the open-source domain, for example, methods in your own utility classes or domain-specific library calls. For more information, see [IntelliCode models based on your code FAQ](custom-models.md).

## Q: How good are the IntelliCode completion suggestions?

Developers at Microsoft have been using IntelliCode’s recommendations internally for some time and believe the suggestions are useful. Additionally, we constantly tune our models based on user feedback and new innovations from our data science teams.

## Q. Why isn’t my favorite library seeing recommendations?

For each languages, we continuously improve its base model's coverage of common libraries and types. If there’s a common library you'd like to see included, use the feedback controls at the bottom of this page to let us know.

For C# users, IntelliCode can learn patterns from your own code. For more information, see [IntelliCode models based on your code](custom-models.md).

## Q: How do I turn starred suggestions off?

To turned starred IntelliSense suggestions off, disable the extension:

- In Visual Studio, choose **Extensions** > **Manage Extensions**, find and select the IntelliCode extension, and then click **Disable**.

- In Visual Studio Code, click **Extensions**, find and select the IntelliCode extension, and then click **Disable**.

## Q. Is it free?

IntelliCode will always have a substantive free tier. Microsoft may start to charge for some of the IntelliCode features in the future.

## Q. What's coming in the future for IntelliCode?
